# Cryosk, a smart contract based ticketing platform

Our group is creating a smart contract based ticketing system that can be used for sporting events, concerts and other live events.

## Goals
1. Create a marketplace that is a trustworthy platform that can be used to buy and sell tickets for live events all over the world
2. Introduce, educate, and bring new users into a world where smart contracts are a new standard for ticketing

## Challenges to a smart contract based ticketing system
1. Onboarding users - for users to begin buying and selling tickets via smart contracts they will need to have the tools to do so (metamask or wallet)
2. Education - smart contracts are in a new and evolving system that is experiencing educational hurdles
3. Trust - with any ticketing system, trust in the marketplace is key. Live event tickets have been susceptible to fraud and there is a high lack of trust between parties in secondary agreements

## Benefits to a smart contract based ticketing system
1. Trust - buyers will be able to review tokens associated to tickets and verify legitimacy before a purchase
2. Stability - a decentralized network will never leave a person stranded at the gate unable to access their tickets
3. Remove third party sites and fees by creating a marketplace that sellers can directly find buyers
